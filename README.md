# Portfolio
My portfolio, this will always be updated, missing a lot of animations and color that I would love to spend an eternity on.
Projects aren't yet linked other than one and there's not a preview for it.
Animations will be added to a load of more items. 04/01: added animations to the tiles with CSS alone, but the way scroll animations are done with just CSS is kinda trash and very niche. Definitely gonna swing JS into this soon.
Art will be added soon, mostly just a self portrait from my sister most-likely.
I'd like to add an inverse effect when hovering over some text to make it really colorful.
